# svm-spam-classifier
Spam classifier built using Support Vector Machines (SVM) with Python's sklearn.svm , numpy, pandas and matplotlib.

Features Linear and Gaussian Kernel functions implementations, SVM parameter _C_ and _sigma_ optimization example, and finally, a comparison between spam classification accuracy between SVM and Logistic regression.

The classifier is a Python 3.6 (conda 4.3.22) implementation of the programming exercise 6 presented in Andrew Ng's "Machine Learning" class on Coursera.
